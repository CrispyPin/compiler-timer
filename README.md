# compiler timer
Add before your compiler and arguments to store a history of compilation times and print statistics.

Example output:
```
<regular compiler output>

Build took 18.025s
Total wasted today: 44m 5s
5 day average: 35m 38s
Overall average: 40m 22s
Since 2023-09-07: 55h 11m 22s
```
